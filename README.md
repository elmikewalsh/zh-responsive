<p>This theme is an adaptation of the original Zenhabits theme, which the site owner (<a href="http://leobabauta.com/" target="_blank">Leo Babauta</a>) offers as an uncopyrighted free download. He also provides a <a href="http://zenhabits.net/install/" target="_blank">set of instructions</a> for installing the theme.</p><p style="text-align: center;">

<p>This version of the Zenhabits WordPress Theme eliminates most of these installation steps, or integrates them into WordPress. (for example, instead of hand-editing the menu links, you can now create the menus directly within the WordPress Custom Menus section) It has also been designed to respond in size to the device being used.</p>

<strong>Note:</strong> This is an old WordPress theme. I neither promise nor provide any support.
