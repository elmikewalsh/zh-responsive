This is based off of the zh1.4 update I created for the original Zen Habits Wordpress theme. The theme is now responsive and will resize according to your screen size! This version also eliminated the need to edit many files manually by integrating the theme with various Wordpress functions. 

The original readme file follows.

zh is an extremely minimalist theme that focuses on the content without distractions. It has a single sidebar. No header. No widgets. No comments. No search. No dynamic sidebar. No nothing.

This theme is uncopyrighted -- use as you like, spread it, sell it, do whatever you want. Thanks and enjoy.


Basic Setup
---------------------------------
Please see the Install page for important instructions:

http://zenhabits.net/install/

This theme is designed to be as minimalist as possible, so I've stripped out a lot of functions that other themes have. That's the choice I've made and I like it that way.

This theme is "as is" - any bugs, you need to fix it. Any changes you want, you'll need to make them.
